# Customer-Existence-Prediciton-In-Bank

This is a Classification Problem in which you'll classify a customer based on his/her Credit Score, Region, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, Salary etc. whether he/she will
EXIT(1) or NOT(0).

In this Model I used XGBoost Algorithm for making Model. Data is divided into Train, Test & Validation Set.

# Modeling
XGBoost is tested in three ways here:

    XGBoost with Default Parameters
    
    XGBoost with RandomizedSearchCv for Hyper-Parameter Tunning
    
    XGBoost with GridSearchCV for Hyper-Parameter Tunning
    
# Metrics
Following Metrics used to compare Models :

    Accuracy (in %)
    
    Precision Score (in %)
    
    Recall Score (in %)
    
    ROC-AUC Score (in %)
